Files to be created:
Three new files are to be created program.txt, input.txt and output.txt. Input.txt and output.txt is located at the location of where the code file is present. Program.txt is located at the home folder on linux. Program.txt file is used for history fucntion whereas input.txt and output.txt are used for I/O function.

Shell working:
When the compilation is done and code is run, then  command to execute is to be entered. After entering the command, the output is displayed. At the command line, if !! is entered, then previous command results is displayed. At the command line, if nothing is written and entered is pressed, then 'no input given' is displayed. At the command line, if after the command, < is written like 'cat <' then data from output.txt file is read and result is displayed. For example, if output.txt file contains 'hello' and 'cat <' is written in command prompt, then 'cat hello' function is displayed at output. At the command line, if after the command, > is written like 'ps >', then the result of the command before '>' is stored in the input.txt file. In case of 'ps >' results of ps command are stored in the input.txt file.

Code explanation is given in .c file.
